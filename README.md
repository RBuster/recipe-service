# recipe-service

Just a normal node service with typescript for handling recipes and user auth for my cookbook app. May remove auth and place it in it's own service if I need it elsewhere, it was probably bad design putting it in here.

`npm run server:watch` for hot reload while dev'in

`npm run start-server` to actually run it with tsc
